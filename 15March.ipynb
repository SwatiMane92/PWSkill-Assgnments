    "# Q1: Explain the following concepts with examples\n",
    "# A. Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "ai_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a broad field that involves creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, and learning from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa, which can understand and respond to voice commands, is an example of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* An AI-based system that can play chess at a grandmaster level by analyzing different possible moves and strategies.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# B. Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "ml_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A spam email filter that learns to identify spam based on the features of past emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A recommendation system on a streaming platform like Netflix, which suggests movies based on user preferences.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# C. Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "dl_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "**Deep Learning (DL)** is a specialized area within ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Image recognition systems that classify objects in photos (like recognizing cats or dogs).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Natural language processing models like GPT-3 that generate human-like text based on large-scale training data.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What is supervised learning? Examples of supervised learning\n",
    "supervised_learning_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "**Supervised Learning** is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data, which means the input data comes with the corresponding correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Classification tasks like spam detection in emails where each email is labeled as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Regression tasks like predicting house prices based on features such as size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: What is unsupervised learning? Examples of unsupervised learning\n",
    "unsupervised_learning_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning** involves training models on data that does not have labeled outcomes. The model tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Clustering tasks like grouping customers into different segments based on purchasing behavior without predefined labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while preserving important information.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "# Q4: Difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS\n",
    "ai_ml_dl_ds_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broadest term that encompasses any technique or system that enables machines to mimic human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI focusing on algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses deep neural networks to model complex patterns and achieve high performance on tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Science (DS):** An interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, data analysis, and ML to extract insights and knowledge from data.\n",

    "# Q5: Differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning\n",
    "learning_types_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train the model. The goal is to predict or classify new, unseen data based on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. There are no predefined labels for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. It is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is plentiful.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Q6: Train, test, and validation split and their importance\n",
    "data_split_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "- **Training Set:** The portion of the dataset used to train the model. It helps the model learn the patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation Set:** A subset of the data used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance during training. It helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Set:** The portion of the data used to assess the model's final performance after training. It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.\n",

    "# Q7: Unsupervised learning in anomaly detection\n",
    "anomaly_detection_explanation = \"\"\"\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning** can be used for anomaly detection by identifying patterns or clusters in the data and flagging data points that deviate significantly from these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card data where most transactions are normal but a few are anomalies.\n",
