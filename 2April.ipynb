    "**Purpose**: Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV) is used to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model by evaluating different parameter values through cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works**:\n",
    "1. **Define Parameter Grid**: Specify a grid of hyperparameters to search through.\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation**: For each combination of parameters, the model is evaluated using cross-validation.\n",
    "3. **Select Best Model**: The combination of parameters that yields the best performance is selected based on a chosen metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).\n",

    "- **Cons**: Computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially with a large parameter grid.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Description**: Randomly samples a subset of hyperparameters from a specified distribution.\n",
