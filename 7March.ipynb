    "# Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "# The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "# 1. Mean\n",
    "# 2. Median\n",
    "# 3. Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "# Mean: The average value of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "# Median: The middle value in a dataset when sorted in ascending order. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "# Mode: The most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.\n",
    "# These measures help summarize and describe the central point of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "height_data = [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "mean_height = np.mean(height_data)\n",
    "median_height = np.median(height_data)\n",
    "mode_height = np.argmax(np.bincount(height_data))\n",
    "\n",
    "mean_height, median_height, mode_height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:\n",
    "std_deviation = np.std(height_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "std_deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "# Measures of dispersion describe the spread or variability of a dataset:\n",
    "# - Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "# - Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "# - Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, showing the average distance from the mean.\n",
    "# Example: In a dataset of test scores, a high standard deviation indicates that scores are spread out from the mean, while a low standard deviation indicates they are clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "# A Venn diagram is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. It uses overlapping circles to represent the relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:\n",
    "A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n",
    "B = {0, 2, 6, 8, 10}\n",
    "\n",
    "# (i) A ∩ B (Intersection)\n",
    "intersection = A & B\n",
    "\n",
    "# (ii) A ∪ B (Union)\n",
    "union = A | B\n",
    "\n",
    "intersection, union\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "# Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution. Positive skew indicates that the tail on the right side is longer or fatter, while negative skew indicates that the tail on the left side is longer or fatter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "# In a right-skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median because the mean is affected by the long tail on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "# Covariance measures how two variables change together, while correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation is normalized and thus ranges from -1 to 1, making it easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.\n",
    "# Formula: Sample Mean = (Sum of all sample values) / (Number of samples)\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "sample_data = [5, 7, 8, 10]\n",
    "sample_mean = np.mean(sample_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "sample_mean\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "# For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "# Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while correlation indicates both the strength and direction. Correlation is standardized, making it easier to compare across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "# Outliers can skew the mean and increase the standard deviation, making these measures less representative of the central tendency and spread. For example, in a dataset of salaries where most salaries are around $50,000 but one is $1,000,000, the mean salary will be much higher than the majority of salaries, and the standard deviation will be large.\n"
