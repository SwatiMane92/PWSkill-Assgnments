    "# Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows the creation of processes that run independently and can \n",
    "#   execute tasks concurrently on different CPU cores. \n",
    "# - It is useful because it helps in parallelizing tasks, allowing for better utilization of multi-core processors, \n",
    "#   thereby improving performance, especially in CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Multiprocessing:\n",
    "#   - Creates separate processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
    "#   - Suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "#   - No Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) issues, making it more efficient for CPU-intensive operations.\n",
    "#   - Processes do not share memory, reducing the chances of data corruption but increasing memory usage.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - Multithreading:\n",
    "#   - Creates multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "#   - Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "#   - Affected by GIL in CPython, which can hinder performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "#   - Threads share memory, which can lead to issues like race conditions if not managed properly.\n",
