    "### Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Scraping** is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the content of web pages, parsing the HTML, and extracting useful information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- **Data Collection:** To gather large amounts of data from various sources for analysis, research, or decision-making.\n",
    "- **Content Aggregation:** To collect content such as news articles, product prices, or reviews from different websites into one place.\n",
    "- **Monitoring and Analysis:** To track changes in data, such as stock prices or competitor products, over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three areas where Web Scraping is used:**\n",
    "1. **E-commerce:** Scraping product prices, reviews, and descriptions to monitor competitors and adjust pricing strategies.\n",
    "2. **Real Estate:** Gathering property listings, prices, and market trends from real estate websites.\n",
    "3. **Finance:** Collecting financial data such as stock prices, currency exchange rates, and economic indicators for analysis and trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manual Scraping:** Manually copying and pasting data from websites (not automated).\n",
    "- **HTML Parsing:** Using libraries like Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of a web page and extract data.\n",
    "- **DOM Parsing:** Using JavaScript and tools like Selenium to interact with dynamic content loaded via JavaScript.\n",
    "- **APIs:** Accessing data provided by websites through their public APIs instead of scraping HTML.\n",
    "- **XPath and CSS Selectors:** Using XPath or CSS selectors to locate specific elements in the HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beautiful Soup** is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree from the page's source code that can be used to extract data easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** Beautiful Soup provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, making web scraping easier and more accessible.\n",
    "- **Integration:** It integrates well with other Python libraries like requests and lxml, allowing for flexible and powerful scraping solutions.\n",
    "- **Handling Incomplete HTML:** Beautiful Soup is designed to work with imperfect HTML, making it robust in handling poorly formatted web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is used in web scraping projects to:\n",
    "- **Create Web APIs:** Expose the scraped data through a RESTful API so that other applications can consume it.\n",
    "- **Build Web Interfaces:** Develop simple web interfaces where users can input queries, and the backend scrapes data in real-time.\n",
    "- **Handle HTTP Requests:** Manage incoming HTTP requests and trigger the web scraping process based on user input or scheduled tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**\n",
    "   - **Use:** To deploy and run the web scraping application on a virtual server in the cloud. EC2 provides the necessary compute resources to run the scraping scripts and the Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**\n",
    "   - **Use:** To store the scraped data in a scalable and durable way. S3 can be used to store raw HTML files, processed data, or results in formats like JSON or CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):**\n",
    "   - **Use:** To store and manage structured data in a relational database. RDS can be used to save scraped data in a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, making it easier to query and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **AWS Lambda:**\n",
    "   - **Use:** To run the scraping scripts in a serverless environment. Lambda can be triggered by events (such as an API call or a schedule) to perform the scraping task without the need for managing servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Amazon CloudWatch:**\n",
    "   - **Use:** To monitor the performance of the scraping scripts and the Flask application. CloudWatch can be used to log events, track metrics, and set alarms for system health.\n",
    "\n",
    "These AWS services provide a robust infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling a web scraping project.\n"
