    "# Q1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "# The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value. The area under the PDF curve over an interval represents the probability that the variable falls within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?\n",
    "# Types of Probability Distributions include:\n",
    "# 1. Normal Distribution\n",
    "# 2. Binomial Distribution\n",
    "# 3. Poisson Distribution\n",
    "# 4. Exponential Distribution\n",
    "# 5. Uniform Distribution\n",

    "# Properties:\n",
    "# 1. The number of trials (n) is fixed.\n",
    "# 2. Each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "# 3. The probability of success (p) is constant for each trial.\n",
    "# 4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# 1. Flipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads.\n",

    "# Q7. How is Binomial distribution different from Poisson distribution?\n",
    "# Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "# - Deals with the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.\n",
    "# - Each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure) with a constant probability of success.\n",
    "# Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "# - Deals with the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "# - The events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.\n",

    "# In a normal distribution, the least frequent data appears in the tails (farther from the mean). This is where the probability density is the lowest.\n"
