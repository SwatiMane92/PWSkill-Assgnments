    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. \n",
    "# In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "# - MongoDB is a popular NoSQL, non-relational database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.\n",
    "# - Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, do not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. \n",
    "#   Instead, they store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.\n",
    "# - Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "#   - When dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "#   - When the data model needs to be flexible and evolve quickly.\n",
    "#   - For use cases requiring high throughput and horizontal scalability.\n",
    "#   - In applications that require fast development cycles, e.g., Agile development.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents, allowing for complex data structures.\n",
    "# - Schema Flexibility: MongoDB allows for a flexible schema, meaning different documents in a collection can have different structures.\n",
    "# - High Performance: MongoDB is designed for high performance, especially for read and write operations.\n",
    "# - Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling via sharding, enabling it to handle large datasets.\n",
    "# - Rich Query Language: MongoDB offers a powerful query language that supports filtering, sorting, and aggregations.\n",
    "# - Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing to improve the efficiency of queries.\n",
    "# - Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework for data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "db = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = db[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "# and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record_one = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "collection.insert_one(record_one)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records_many = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Mike\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"Chicago\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Sara\", \"age\": 28, \"city\": \"Houston\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "collection.insert_many(records_many)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find and print one record\n",
    "print(\"Find one record:\", collection.find_one({\"name\": \"John\"}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find and print all records\n",
    "print(\"Find all records:\")\n",
    "for record in collection.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. \n",
    "# Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - The find() method is used to query documents in a collection. \n",
    "#   It can take parameters to filter the documents returned based on specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Find all records where age is greater than 25\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}\n",
    "results = collection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Records where age is greater than 25:\")\n",
    "for record in results:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - The sort() method is used to sort the documents returned by a query. \n",
    "#   It can sort in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Sort records by age in ascending order\n",
    "sorted_records = collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Records sorted by age in ascending order:\")\n",
    "for record in sorted_records:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - delete_one(): Deletes the first document that matches the filter criteria.\n",
    "#   Example: collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# - delete_many(): Deletes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "#   Example: collection.delete_many({\"city\": \"New York\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# - drop(): Deletes the entire collection from the database.\n",
    "#   Example: collection.drop()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete one record\n",
    "collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"Mike\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete many records\n",
    "collection.delete_many({\"city\": \"New York\"})\n",
