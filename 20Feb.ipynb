    "# Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The GET and POST methods are two of the most common HTTP methods used in web applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **GET Method**:\n",
    "#   - The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "#   - It is the default method when a form or a URL is submitted.\n",
    "#   - Data sent through the GET method is appended to the URL as query parameters, and can be seen in the URL.\n",
    "#   - GET requests should only retrieve data and should not alter server state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **POST Method**:\n",
    "#   - The POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource.\n",
    "#   - Data sent through the POST method is included in the request body, and is not visible in the URL.\n",
    "#   - POST requests are typically used when submitting forms, uploading files, or sending data that will modify the server's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `request` object in Flask is used to access incoming request data. It allows you to retrieve information such as form data, query parameters, headers, cookies, and more.\n",
    "# The `request` object is essential for handling and processing data sent by the client to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `redirect()` function in Flask is used to redirect the user to a different URL. It is commonly used when you want to guide the user to another page after performing a certain action, such as after a form submission or login.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of `redirect()`:\n",
    "from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to the Home Page!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/login')\n",
    "def login():\n",
    "    # Redirect to the home page after login\n",
    "    return redirect(url_for('home'))\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "# After running this code, visiting the /login URL will redirect the user to the home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Templates in Flask are files that contain HTML (and optionally embedded Python code) that define the structure and layout of a web page.\n",
    "# Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to render templates. Templates allow you to separate the presentation layer from the logic layer in your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `render_template()` function is used to render a template and return it as a response to the client.\n",
    "# You can pass variables to the template using this function, allowing for dynamic content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of `render_template()`:\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html', title='Home Page')\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "# For this code to work, you should have an `index.html` file in a `templates` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Create a simple API. Use Postman to test it. Attach the screenshot of the output in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
    "def api_data():\n",
    "    if request.method == 'GET':\n",
    "        data = {'message': 'This is a GET request'}\n",
    "        return jsonify(data)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        posted_data = request.get_json()\n",
    "        response = {\n",
    "            'message': 'This is a POST request',\n",
    "            'data_received': posted_data\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return jsonify(response)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "# To test this API using Postman:\n",
    "# - Send a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/data and observe the JSON response.\n",
    "# - Send a POST request to the same URL with a JSON body (e.g., {\"name\": \"John\"}) and observe the response containing the posted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make sure to take screenshots of the Postman outputs and include them in your Jupyter Notebook.\n"
