    "Q1. **Homogeneity and Completeness**:\n",
    "   - **Homogeneity** measures if all data points in a cluster have the same ground truth class. It is calculated as the ratio of the entropy of the true labels to the entropy of the predicted labels within a cluster.\n",
    "   - **Completeness** measures if all data points of a given class are assigned to the same cluster. It is calculated as the ratio of the entropy of the predicted labels to the entropy of the true labels within a cluster.\n",
    "   - Both metrics are calculated using: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Homogeneity} = 1 - \\frac{H(C|T)}{H(C)}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Completeness} = 1 - \\frac{H(T|C)}{H(T)}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\(H\\) denotes entropy, \\(C\\) is the cluster labels, and \\(T\\) is the true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **V-Measure**:\n",
    "   - The V-measure is a measure of the balance between homogeneity and completeness. It is defined as the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{V-Measure} = \\frac{(1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\text{Homogeneity} \\cdot \\text{Completeness}}{\\beta^2 \\cdot \\text{Homogeneity} + \\text{Completeness}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - Here, \\(\\beta\\) is a parameter that balances the contribution of homogeneity and completeness. Typically, \\(\\beta = 1\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Silhouette Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - The Silhouette Coefficient measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1:\n",
    "     - **1**: Perfect clustering.\n",
    "     - **0**: Overlapping clusters.\n",
    "     - **-1**: Misclassified points.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Silhouette} = \\frac{b - a}{\\max(a, b)}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\(a\\) is the average distance to other points in the same cluster and \\(b\\) is the average distance to points in the nearest cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Davies-Bouldin Index**:\n",
    "   - The Davies-Bouldin Index measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster that is most similar to it. It is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{DBI} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\max_{j \\ne i} \\frac{s_i + s_j}{d_{ij}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     where \\(s_i\\) is the average distance between points in cluster \\(i\\), and \\(d_{ij}\\) is the distance between cluster centers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\n",
    "   - A lower DBI indicates better clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **High Homogeneity, Low Completeness**:\n",
    "   - A clustering result may have high homogeneity if each cluster predominantly contains data points from a single class, but if some classes are not fully captured, completeness will be low.\n",
    "   - Example: If one cluster only contains class A but misses class B, and another cluster contains only class B, completeness will be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **V-Measure for Optimal Number of Clusters**:\n",
    "   - To determine the optimal number of clusters, calculate the V-measure for different numbers of clusters and choose the number that maximizes V-measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Silhouette Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**:\n",
    "     - Provides a single metric to evaluate clustering quality.\n",
    "     - Ranges from -1 to 1, making it easy to interpret.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "     - May not work well with clusters of different densities.\n",
    "     - Can be sensitive to the number of clusters chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Limitations of Davies-Bouldin Index**:\n",
    "   - **Limitations**:\n",
    "     - Assumes clusters are compact and spherical.\n",
    "     - May not perform well with clusters of different densities.\n",
    "   - **Overcoming Limitations**:\n",
    "     - Use in conjunction with other metrics like silhouette coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **Relationship Between Metrics**:\n",
    "   - **Homogeneity, Completeness, and V-Measure**:\n",
    "     - Homogeneity and completeness are components of V-measure. They can have different values based on clustering results.\n",
    "     - V-measure balances these two metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **Comparing Clustering Algorithms with Silhouette Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - Use the Silhouette Coefficient to compare different algorithms by evaluating their clustering quality on the same dataset.\n",
    "   - Potential Issues: May not be suitable for all cluster shapes or densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. **Davies-Bouldin Index and Cluster Quality**:\n",
    "   - Measures separation (distance between clusters) and compactness (distance within clusters).\n",
    "   - Assumes spherical clusters with uniform density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. **Silhouette Coefficient and Hierarchical Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Yes, the Silhouette Coefficient can be used to evaluate hierarchical clustering. It assesses how well-separated and well-formed the clusters are, regardless of the clustering method used.\n",
