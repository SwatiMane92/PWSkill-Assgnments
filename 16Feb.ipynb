    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n",
    "# - SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "#   - Relational databases that use tables to store data.\n",
    "#   - Data is structured in a predefined schema.\n",
    "#   - Follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).\n",
    "#   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "#   - Non-relational databases that can store unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "#   - Flexible schema, allowing for dynamic changes in data structure.\n",
    "#   - Suitable for handling large volumes of data and distributed data storage.\n",
    "#   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL that deals with defining and modifying database structures like tables, indexes, and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# 1. CREATE: Used to create a new table or database.\n",
    "#    Example: CREATE TABLE Students (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(100), Age INT);\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. DROP: Used to delete a table or database.\n",
    "#    Example: DROP TABLE Students;\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing table.\n",
    "#    Example: ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN Grade VARCHAR(2);\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table but keep the structure.\n",
    "#    Example: TRUNCATE TABLE Students;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a subset of SQL used for inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# 1. INSERT: Used to insert new records into a table.\n",
    "#    Example: INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. UPDATE: Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "#    Example: UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. DELETE: Used to remove records from a table.\n",
    "#    Example: DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - DQL (Data Query Language) is a subset of SQL used for querying data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# SELECT: Used to retrieve data from a table.\n",
    "# Example: SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Age > 18;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Primary Key:\n",
    "#   - A unique identifier for each record in a table.\n",
    "#   - Cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "#   - Ensures that each record in a table is unique.\n",
    "#   - Example: In a Students table, the ID column can be a Primary Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Foreign Key:\n",
    "#   - A field in one table that links to the Primary Key in another table.\n",
    "#   - Establishes a relationship between two tables.\n",
    "#   - Example: In an Enrollment table, the Student_ID column can be a Foreign Key referencing the ID column in the Students table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing the connection\n",
    "conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",\n",
    "    database=\"your_database\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# cursor() method creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries on the database.\n",
    "# execute() method is used to execute a single SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Students\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching and printing the result\n",
    "result = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in result:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the connection\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The order of execution of SQL clauses is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. FROM: The table(s) from which data is to be retrieved.\n",
    "# 2. WHERE: Filters the rows based on the specified condition.\n",
    "# 3. GROUP BY: Groups the rows that have the same values in specified columns.\n",
    "# 4. HAVING: Filters the groups based on the specified condition.\n",
    "# 5. SELECT: Selects the columns that are to be returned.\n",
    "# 6. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on the specified columns.\n",
    "# 7. LIMIT/OFFSET: Limits the number of rows returned or skips rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# SELECT Name, COUNT(*) FROM Students WHERE Age > 18 GROUP BY Name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ORDER BY Name LIMIT 10;\n"
