    "**Ordinal Encoding**: This encoding method assigns integers to categories based on their order. It is used when there is a meaningful order among categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding**: This method assigns integers to categories without assuming any order. It is used when there is no inherent ordinal relationship among categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding**: For a feature 'Education Level' with values ['High School', 'Bachelor', 'Master', 'PhD'], the encoding could be [0, 1, 2, 3].\n",
    "- **Label Encoding**: For a feature 'Color' with values ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'], the encoding could be [0, 1, 2] with no implied order.\n",

    "*Choosing One Over the Other:*\n",

    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**: This method involves encoding categorical values based on the target variable's mean or median for each category. It creates an ordinal feature where the order reflects the target's relationship with the categories.\n",
