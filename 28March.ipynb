      "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. It helps in regularizing the model and reducing overfitting.\n",
      "- Unlike Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, which aims to minimize the residual sum of squares without any penalty, Ridge Regression includes a penalty term 位 * sum(coefficients^2) in its loss function.\n",

      "Q2: Assumptions of Ridge Regression\n",
      "\n",
      "Ridge Regression shares the following assumptions with OLS Regression:\n",
      "1. Linearity: The relationship between the predictors and the response variable is linear.\n",
      "2. Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
      "3. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals.\n",
      "4. Normality: Residuals are normally distributed (although less critical in Ridge Regression due to regularization).\n",

      "Q6: Handling Categorical and Continuous Variables in Ridge Regression\n",
      "\n",
      "Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables, but categorical variables need to be encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding) before they can be used.\n",

      "The coefficients in Ridge Regression represent the effect of each feature on the target variable, similar to OLS Regression.\n",
      "- However, due to regularization, the coefficients are shrunk towards zero, which means they are generally smaller and more stable.\n",
