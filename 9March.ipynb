    "# PMF: A Probability Mass Function is used for discrete random variables, giving the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",

    "# Central Limit Theorem: It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the original distribution of the data.\n",
