    "**Min-Max Scaling**: Min-Max scaling (also known as normalization) transforms features to a fixed range, usually [0, 1]. It rescales each feature to ensure that its minimum value becomes 0 and its maximum value becomes 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How It Works:*\n",
    "1. For each feature, subtract the minimum value of the feature.\n",
    "2. Divide the result by the range (maximum value - minimum value) of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "Let's apply Min-Max scaling to the dataset [1, 5, 10, 15, 20].\n",

    "**Unit Vector Scaling**: Unit Vector Scaling (also known as normalization or vector normalization) scales the feature values so that the length (or magnitude) of the vector is 1. It converts the feature values into a unit vector.\n",

    "2. PCA may reduce these to 2 principal components that capture the majority of the variance.\n",
